    <h4>Life and Death</h4>
      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#birth">
        Ælfred was born in Wantage in 849 to Æthelwulf of Wessex &hellip;
      </summary>
      <details id="birth" class="collapse">
        and his first wife, Osburh.  He was their youngest child and fifth son.
He was a sickly child thought to have suffered from Crohn's disease all his life.
Ælfred may have been 25 years younger than his eldest brother and as the baby of the
family born to parents in the later years may have been especially favoured.  However,
his father died before he was 10 and it is likely his mother died before he was 6.
      </details>
      <br>
      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#childhood">
        Ælfred was not born to be King and his ill health &hellip;
      </summary>
      <details id="childhood" class="collapse">
        combined to suggest perhaps a life of learning and high position in the church.
The story is told of how Ælfred won a book of Saxon poems from his mother by being the
first to learn to read it.
However, at the age of 4, Ælfred accompanied his father on pilgrimage to Rome.
This and the stay at the Carolingian court on the way back must have broaden Ælfred's horizons.
      </details>

      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#adulthood">
        Ælfred became heir to the throne in 865 and King in 871 &hellip;
      </summary>
      <details id="adulthood" class="collapse">
but he was pre-occupied with the Viking threat his whole adult life.
Ælfred was King in the old Germanic sense of protector, not ruler, of the land and its people.
He bought peace when he could, fought when he had to
and his many reforms may be seen as a strategy of defence in depth.
      </details>
      <br>
      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#death">
        Ælfred died in 899 and was succeeded by his son &hellip;

Edward the Elder.  He was first buried in the Old Minster in Winchester.
His remains were soon moved to the New Minster and, after the Norman Conquest, to Hyde Abbey.
After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the abbey was demolished and his grave lost.
It is thought Ælfred's grave was destroyed and his remain scattered in the 18th century
when a prison was built on the site.

      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ashdown">
        Ælfred, fighting beside his brother, defended Wessex and &hellip;
      </summary>
      <details id="ashdown" class="collapse">
      Mercia from the Great Heathen Army that had arrived in 865 and quickly conquered East Anglia and Northumbria.
871 saw the arrival of the Great Summer Army, nine battles and the death of his brother.
Ælfred is credited with the victory at the Battle of Ashdown
but, on becoming King, Ælfred sued for peace and bought the Vikings off.
      </details>

      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#defeat">
        Ælfred retreated into the marshland of the Somerset Levels &hellip;
      </summary>
      <details id="defeat" class="collapse">
        after a surprise attack by the new Danish King Guthrum in early 878.
Mercia had been conquered and Wessex overrun:  the outlook was bleak.
However, only a few months later Ælfred re-emerged, raised the fyrds of
three shires and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington.
Guthrum was besieged and starved into submission.
The terms of which included his conversion to Christianity.

      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#danelaw">
        Ælfred's lasting peace with Guthrum created the Danelaw &hellip;

      <details id="danelaw" class="collapse">
which lay north and east of a line running up Watling Street from London to Chester.
Here Danish rule and Danish law prevailed.
This partition of England is reflected particularly in place names and regional dialects.
It is the origin of the North-South divide that still affects English society and politics today.
      </details>
      <br>
      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#restoration">
        Ælfred began the restoration of London and its mint in 886 &hellip;
      </summary>
      <details id="restoration" class="collapse">
        during the relatively peaceful years following the treaty with Guthrum.
Saxon London had lain north of the Thames in Mercia but had been abandoned.
South of the river, in Wessex, lay the royal borough of Kingston where several Saxon kings were crowned.
The restoration demonstrated Ælfred's confidence and power over Anglo-Saxon England.

    <h4>Rule and Reforms</h4>
      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#burhs">
        Ælfred constructed thirty or so forts named burhs (boroughs) &hellip;
      </summary>
      <details id="burhs" class="collapse">
        in a strategic system that confounded later Viking invasions.
They were garrisoned refuges for local people situated so
nowhere in the kingdom was more than a day's march from a burgh.
Many were twin towns either side of a river connected by a fortified bridge
that denied passage to Viking ships.
      </details>
      <br>
      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#legal">
        Ælfred's reform of the legal code is called the Doom book &hellip;
      </summary>
      <details id="legal" class="collapse">
        and comprises his own laws and the earlier laws of King Ine.
Fundamental to Anglo-Saxon law was for each man to uphold his oath to his Lord.
This was the only law that could not be compensated for with payment.
Ælfred required his judges be literate but the Doom book cannot be seen as a legal manual.
      </details>

      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#education">
        Ælfred's created a court school to educate his children &hellip;
      </summary>
      <details id="education" class="collapse">
        and those of his nobles in English and Latin.
Ælfred attracted Welsh and continental scolars and scribes to his court.  He revived manuscript production and Christian learning.
He proposed the education in English of all freemen and even translated several "books of wisdom" himself.
      </details>
      <br>
      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#history">
        Ælfred commissioned a biography and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle &hellip;
      </summary>
      <details id="history" class="collapse">
        both important for historic and linguistic reasons.
The biography, by Bishop Asser, is a contemporary, detailed, accurate, although
flattering, account of the life and times of Ælfred.
The Chronicle is not unbiased but is the most important source of English history
from the departure of the Romans to the decades following the Norman conquest.

    <h4>Legacy and Legend</h4>
      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#saxon">
        Ælfred was eclipsed in Saxon times by his grandson &hellip;
      </summary>
      <details id="saxon" class="collapse">
        Æthelstan, the first Anglo-Saxon ruler of the whole of England.
However, Ælfred's reorganisation of the military and navy, his reforms of taxation, coinage, administration and law laid the ground work.
The crown of Anglo-Saxon England was coveted.
Finally William the Bastard, himself of Viking descent, usurped the throne.
      </details>

      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#medieval">
        Ælfred was never canonised despite Henry VI's efforts &hellip;
      </summary>
      <details id="medieval" class="collapse">
so he was not a patron of the medieval nobility as were Kings Edmund and Edward.
His tomb at Hyde Abbey was, however, a place of pilgrimage for lesser folk.
In the oldest misappropriation of Ælfred's legacy, 14th century Oxford claimed him as founder of the University.
    </details>

      <summary type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#tudor">
        Ælfred's epithet the Great dates from the Elizabethan era &hellip;

      <details id="tudor" class="collapse">
        when the Anglican church appropriated him as a pious Christian ruler (true) free of Papal influence (false).
Ælfred and Elizabeth both faced threat of invasion.  Each oversaw a court renaissance that reflected an earlier continental renaissance, was loved by their people and left a country that was the envy of their neighbours.

      <details id="millenium" class="collapse">
the Empress Victoria died.
The British saw in him as a reflection of their world view.
Ælfred was no empire builder of superior race but a pious man with a divine duty to protect, not a divine right to rule, his people. He believed literacy and wisdom, a strong and just society and alliances, not war and conquest, were the way to win peace.
