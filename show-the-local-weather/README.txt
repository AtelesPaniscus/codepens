 Free Code Camp  Project #4.

This uses the HTML5 geolocation API to get the user's current location (wildly inaccurate without GPS).

It then uses Open Street map to get the location it terms the user might understand and the Free Code Camp weather API to get what the user can see just by looking out the window.

The final touch is to use the weather icons provided by FCC for use on this project.
