 Free Code Camp Project #8.

The JavaScript for this project uses objects.  It uses timer intervals.  The pomodoro itself is drawn using border-radius rather than SVG circles.

You should be able to click anywhere to start/stop the clock and you can:  it is just much more reliable if you click on the clock itself.  I have no idea why.
